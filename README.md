Hello!
This is my metric to imperial converter for Assignment 3.
You can convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, centimeters to inches, kilograms to ounces, kilometers to yards, and kiloleters to liters.
To start the program, you can press '1'. To end the program, you can press '-1'.
Then, you will enter a number that you wish to convert. (Ex. '2.54')
Next, you will enter the measurement unit. (Can pick from: C, cm, kg, km, kl)
It will give you answer, and it will let you do as many conversions as you wish, until you quit.
If you select a negative number or a measurement unit that is not listed, it will prompt you to fix your response.
Have fun! :)
